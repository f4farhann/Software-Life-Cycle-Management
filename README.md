Knowledge Based Life Cycle Management for Applications &amp;   Infrastructure Components in Scaled Hyper Converged Software Defined Data Centers
Proposing a Knowledge Based Life Cycle Management method for the Infrastructure Components and the Applications in the Scaled Hyper Converged Software Defined Data Centers is a project to manage life cycle Management (LCM) software which will look for “Best Window time” or “best time” to perform Life Cycle Management.  So that the Administrator can perform LCM whenever upgrade or patch is available for any entity (Application or Infrastructure component) .
